                           <h2>22. COURSE TERMINATION& REFUND</h2>
                           <p>SpireTec Solutions offers a 7-Day Moneyback Guarantee (no questions asked) from the date of purchase. Even after attending the course, if you feel the course is not of your liking or it’s not up to your expectation, you may terminate it. In online class termination, SpireTec shall process a full refund if the cancelation request comes before 25% of the course completion. In on-site classroom training, the refund is processed only when the cancelation request is raised not more than 1 day later to the commencement of the class. </p>
                           <p>SpireTec on its sole discretion may terminate your course at any time on reasonable grounds, which shall include, without limitation, any reasonable belief of fraudulent or unlawful activity or actions or omissions that violate any term or condition of this TOS, to deny your access to the SpireTec Website or to any portion thereof in order to protect its name and goodwill, its business, and/or other Authorized Users, and this TOS will also terminate automatically if you fail to comply with this TOS, subject to the survival rights of certain provisions identified below. Termination will be effective without notice.</p>

                           <h2>23. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</h2>
                           <p>You expressly absolve and release SpireTec Solutions from any claim of harm resulting from a cause beyond SpireTec Solutions control, including, but not limited to, failure of electronic or mechanical equipment or communication lines, telephone or other connection problems, computer viruses, unauthorized access, theft, operator errors, severe weather, earthquakes, or natural disasters, strikes, or other labour problems, wars, or governmental restrictions. </p>
                           <p>Under no circumstances, shall SpireTec Solutions be liable for any indirect, punitive, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising out of or in any way connected with the use of the SpireTec Solutions website, with the delay or inability to use the SpireTec Solutions website, or for any information, services, programs, products, and materials available through the SpireTec Solutions website, whether based in contract, tort, strict liability, or otherwise, even if SpireTec Solutions has been advised of the possibility of such damages. Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply. </p>
                           <p>Notwithstanding the foregoing, total liability of SpireTec Solutions for any reason whatsoever related to use of the SpireTec Solutions website shall not exceed the total amount paid by you to SpireTec Solutions in connection with the subject matter of the dispute.</p>

                           <p>You acknowledge that any breach, threatened or actual, of this TOS will cause irreparable injury to SpireTec Solutions, such injury would not be quantifiable in monetary damages, and SpireTec Solutions would not have an adequate remedy at law. You therefore agree that SpireTec Solutions shall be entitled, in addition to other available remedies, to seek and be awarded an injunction or other appropriate equitable relief from a court of competent jurisdiction restraining any breach, threatened or actual, of your obligations under any provision of this TOS. </p>
                           <p>Accordingly, you hereby waive any requirement that SpireTec Solutions post any bond or other security in the event any injunctive or equitable relief is sought by or awarded to SpireTec Solutions to enforce any provision of this TOS. The parties agree that this TOS is for the benefit of the parties hereto as well as SpireTec Solutions licensors. Accordingly, this TOS is personal to you, and you may not assign your rights or obligations to any other person or entity without SpireTec Solutions prior written consent. You agree that SpireTec Solutions may assign any rights, duties or benefits under this TOS or then entire TOS to any of its subsidiaries or affiliates at any time without notice. Failure by SpireTec Solutions to insist on strict performance of any of the terms and conditions of this TOS will not operate as a waiver by SpireTec Solutions of that or any subsequent default or failure of performance. If any provision (or part thereof) contained in this TOS is determined to be void, invalid, or otherwise unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or on account of a conflict with an applicable government regulation, such determination shall not affect the remaining provisions (or parts thereof) contained herein and the illegal, invalid, or unenforceable clause shall be modified in compliance with applicable law in a manner that most closely matches the intent of the original language. </p>
                           <p>This TOS, along with the SpireTec Solutions Privacy Policy and additional terms associated with the course you choose, represents the entire agreement between you and SpireTec Solutions, collectively these terms dominate all previous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral, or written between you and SpireTec Solutions regarding the Website and the tools, course materials, or information, i.e., content offered through it.</p>
